# Deployment Guide - Clerk Authentication Fix

## Required Environment Variables for Clerk

Make sure these environment variables are set in your deployment platform (Vercel, Netlify, etc.):

### Required Clerk Environment Variables:
```
NEXT_PUBLIC_CLERK_PUBLISHABLE_KEY=pk_test_...
CLERK_SECRET_KEY=sk_test_...
NEXT_PUBLIC_CLERK_SIGN_IN_URL=/sign-in
NEXT_PUBLIC_CLERK_SIGN_UP_URL=/sign-up
NEXT_PUBLIC_CLERK_AFTER_SIGN_IN_URL=/dashboard
NEXT_PUBLIC_CLERK_AFTER_SIGN_UP_URL=/dashboard
```

### Other Required Environment Variables:
```
DATABASE_URL=postgresql://...
STRIPE_SECRET_KEY=sk_test_...

```

## Common Clerk Deployment Issues:

1. **Missing Environment Variables**: The most common cause of sign-in issues
2. **Incorrect URLs**: Make sure all URLs match your deployment domain
3. **CORS Issues**: Ensure your domain is added to Clerk's allowed origins
4. **Middleware Issues**: Check that middleware is properly configured

## Steps to Fix:

1. **Verify Environment Variables**: Check that all Clerk environment variables are set in your deployment platform
2. **Check Clerk Dashboard**: Ensure your domain is added to the allowed origins in Clerk dashboard
3. **Test Locally**: Make sure authentication works in development
4. **Clear Browser Cache**: Sometimes cached authentication state causes issues

## Debugging Steps:

1. Check browser console for any Clerk-related errors
2. Verify network requests to Clerk APIs are successful
3. Check that the middleware is not blocking authentication requests
4. Ensure the ClerkProvider is properly wrapping your app



## Recent Changes Made:

1. Fixed ESLint configuration
2. Added explicit redirect URLs to SignIn and SignUp components
3. Improved middleware formatting
4. Added proper error handling
5. **NEW**: Simplified user storage - users are automatically saved on first sign-in
6. **NEW**: Removed unnecessary tracking complexity

If the issue persists, check the browser console for specific error messages and verify all environment variables are correctly set in your deployment platform.
